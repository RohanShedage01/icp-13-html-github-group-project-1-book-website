      pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread
      dough topped with some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives,
      mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked
      quickly—usually, in a commercial setting, using a wood-fired oven heated
      to a very high temperature—and served hot.

      Biryani (/bɜːrˈjɑːni/) is a mixed rice dish originating among the Muslims
      of the Indian subcontinent. It is made with Indian spices, rice, and
      usually some type of meat (chicken, beef, goat, lamb, prawn, fish) or in
      some cases without any meat, and sometimes, in addition, eggs and
      potatoes.
